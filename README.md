# subagogo.coms
Sofware from Subagogo COMS systems. This allows the updating of multiple web browsers via remote control or automation.

This project started as a tv game show system but as I developed it I realized the game show was just an 'app' on top of the underlying COMS system.

Any number of web browsers can connect to the system and be independently updated via api, direct system writes, or remote control.

The demo was built in 2022. Her's a video of one of the test runs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYzaSES-kT4

In that video I'm the MC controlling the game flow through my smart phone. 

All displays a web browsers in full screen mode. Each system must have it's screen timeouts disabled.

The large monitor is a FIRESTICK which requires adb access to disable the timeout.

The score monitors are 2nd monitors connected to Chromebooks on the podiums.

Initially I considered charging a fee for monthly access but I did not like the idea of someone having to rely on the Internet to use it which could cause reliability or security issues.

I will offer an online server version at https://www.subagogo.com/ and also provide details to build a local server.

This system can run on outdated hardware with no degradation as it's not doing any heavy processing.

to be updated....
